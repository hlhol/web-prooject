The School Advisory Committee (SAC) is a vital organization that brings together parents, teachers, school administrators, and community members to work collaboratively in supporting the school’s mission and enhancing student success. The SAC serves as an advisory body, providing valuable feedback and recommendations on school policies, academic programs, and initiatives to create a positive and inclusive environment for all students.
By fostering open communication and encouraging active participation from all stakeholders, the SAC strengthens the partnership between the school and its community. This collaboration ensures that the voices of parents, students, and educators are heard and reflected in decisions that impact the school’s growth and development.
The SAC also plays a key role in promoting student achievement, advocating for resources, and supporting initiatives that enhance the overall school experience. From reviewing school improvement plans to addressing challenges, the SAC is committed to building a learning environment where every student can thrive.

                The school nurse acts as the health service expert, delivering care to students and staff while implementing strategies to address both current and potential health and safety concerns. By collaborating with school administrators,
