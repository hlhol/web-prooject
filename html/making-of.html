                <h3>Impact of HTML, CSS, and JS Code on Maintainability</h3>
                <p>
                    The website is built with a focus on maintainability, utilizing semantic HTML and a consistent use of div elements to structure the layout. By encapsulating each section and component within div tags and with clear class and ID naming conventions we create a clear and organized codebase that enhances readability and simplifies future updates. This modular approach allows for easy adjustments to individual sections without affecting the overall layout.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    CSS is structured to apply styles to these div elements efficiently, promoting reusability and reducing redundancy. JavaScript is used judiciously to enhance interactivity while keeping the codebase lightweight and efficient. This thoughtful approach to coding ensures that future developers can easily understand and modify the site, accommodating upgrades and new features without extensive rework.
