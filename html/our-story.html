                We created a website for a private school, focusing on many topics, such as Admissions, Community, News, the Making of the Website, and Our Story. The Home page includes information about us, the aims of the school, an image slider, and a registration form. The Admissions page covers school fees and campus life. The Community page shows the school advisory committee, health services, and booster clubs. The News page contains the achievements, along with a short video. First, we designed our website in Canva before moving into implementation. After that, we started working on the website pages, ensuring responsive design across different devices. Every page was designed to enhance the user experience by striking a balance between content and simple navigation, making the website user-friendly and easy to use.

            <p>
                During our experience with the project, we encountered challenges that highlighted essential principles of effective teamwork that we had not sufficiently emphasized. One significant issue was the lack of cooperation and participation among team members. By focusing on collaboration, we could have completed the project more quickly through the exchange of ideas and experiences, rather than assigning tasks individually, which limited our collective effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                We also faced challenges in time management, failing to allocate enough time to complete tasks within our previously set deadlines. Improved implementation of time management principles would have greatly enhanced our overall group experience. Additionally, communication difficulties arose among team members; however, we addressed this issue by holding meetings via Microsoft Teams. Differing viewpoints on the site’s design and required features led to several revisions as we worked to accommodate everyone's opinions. While some team members struggled with new technological techniques, these challenges ultimately provided opportunities for skill enhancement and knowledge growth.              
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, we recognized that improving cooperation, time management, and effective communication could lead to better results. This project became a valuable learning experience that strengthened our abilities as a team.

                Through our work on the project, we discovered the significance of having a clear plan that outlines roles and establishes deadlines for each team member, which kept us focused and organized. We employed various principles of effective group work, such as understanding our strengths, which allowed us to allocate tasks effectively and enable each member to contribute their best work. For instance, those with strong coding skills focused on developing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while others who excelled in design concentrated on enhancing the visual appeal and creating an engaging user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                We also recognized the importance of effective communication among team members to prevent misunderstandings and ensure a smooth workflow. Actively listening to each other helped us understand different concepts and perspectives, build respect and trust, and make every member feel heard. Furthermore, reviewing each other’s work and providing respectful feedback allowed us to learn from our mistakes and improve our overall performance. Additionally, facing challenges, such as differing opinions on design, provided opportunities to nurture creativity and innovation as we collaborated to find solutions that satisfied everyone’s needs. Overall, this experience strengthened our ability to work as a cohesive team and achieve positive results that reflect our collective efforts while also enhancing our skills.

            <br>
            <p>

                The project enhanced our understanding of front-end development, especially in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working with Canva helped us grasp design fundamentals, such as spacing, color palettes, and layout. We learned how to create multi-page navigation and structure each page for clarity and usability. In addition, we learned how to implement responsive design techniques like Flexbox, ensuring that the site was easy to navigate on both mobile phones and desktop computers.             </p>
            <p>
                
                Moreover, making an image slider with both autoplay functionality and manual navigation buttons provided us with real-world experience in using JavaScript to make the website more interactive. We utilized the Document Object Model (DOM) to enhance users’ flexibility. Users could choose to manually scroll among the images or allow them to rotate automatically. Also, the navigation bar we implemented provided quick access to different sections of the website, making the information more accessible.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                We used GitHub for version control, which enabled us to organize our contributions, track our progress, and manage code changes efficiently. Furthermore, we explored various methods to implement the features in the best possible way by searching on Google for examples and documentation. This enabled us to gather a variety of insights and strategies. To conclude, working on this project significantly enhanced our understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
